# BayesianRepertoireOverlap

The notebook [manuscriptCalculations.ipynb](https://github.com/dblarremore/BayesianRepertoireOverlap/blob/master/manuscriptCalculations.ipynb) reproduces all figures and calculations of the manuscript that accompanies this project.

The file util.py is from Samuel Way, and includes some shortcuts to making nicer plots.

All code written by [Daniel Larremore](http://danlarremore.com).
