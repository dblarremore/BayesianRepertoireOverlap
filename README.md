# BayesianRepertoireOverlap

The notebook [manuscriptCalculations.ipynb](https://github.com/dblarremore/BayesianRepertoireOverlap/blob/master/manuscriptCalculations.ipynb) reproduces all figures and calculations of the manuscript that accompanies this project.

To read the paper that is the basis of all calculations, see [PLOS Comp Bio](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006898).

The file util.py is from Samuel Way, and includes some shortcuts to making nicer plots.

All code written by [Daniel Larremore](http://danlarremore.com).
